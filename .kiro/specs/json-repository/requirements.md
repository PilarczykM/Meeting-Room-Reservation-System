# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current meeting room reservation system uses an in-memory repository that loses all data when the application restarts. This feature will implement a JSON-based repository that persists meeting room data to disk, ensuring bookings survive application restarts while maintaining the existing DDD architecture and repository interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want my meeting room bookings to persist between application sessions, so that I don't lose my reservations when the application is restarted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is restarted THEN all previously created bookings SHALL be available
2. WHEN a booking is created THEN the system SHALL save it to persistent storage immediately
3. WHEN a booking is cancelled THEN the system SHALL remove it from persistent storage immediately
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load existing bookings from persistent storage

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the JSON repository to implement the same interface as the in-memory repository, so that the change is transparent to the rest of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the JSON repository is implemented THEN it SHALL implement the MeetingRoomRepository interface
2. WHEN the JSON repository is used THEN all existing application services SHALL work without modification
3. WHEN the repository is configured THEN the dependency injection container SHALL use the JSON repository instead of the in-memory one

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the JSON storage to be robust and handle errors gracefully, so that the application remains stable even when file operations fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the JSON file cannot be read THEN the system SHALL start with an empty repository and log the error
2. WHEN the JSON file cannot be written THEN the system SHALL raise an appropriate exception
3. WHEN the JSON file is corrupted THEN the system SHALL start with an empty repository and log the error
4. WHEN the storage directory doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create it automatically

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the JSON storage to be configurable, so that I can specify where my booking data is stored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no storage path is configured THEN the system SHALL use a default data directory
2. WHEN a custom storage path is provided THEN the system SHALL use that path for JSON storage
3. WHEN the storage path is relative THEN the system SHALL resolve it relative to the application root
4. WHEN the storage path is absolute THEN the system SHALL use it as-is

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the JSON repository to be thread-safe, so that concurrent operations don't corrupt the data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple threads access the repository simultaneously THEN data integrity SHALL be maintained
2. WHEN a save operation is in progress THEN other operations SHALL wait for completion
3. WHEN a read operation is in progress THEN other read operations SHALL be allowed concurrently
4. WHEN a write operation is in progress THEN read operations SHALL return consistent data
