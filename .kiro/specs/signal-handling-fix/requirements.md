# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Signal Handling Fix feature addresses the issue where SIGINT (Ctrl+C) signals are not properly handled during interactive CLI operations. Currently, when users press Ctrl+C during booking or cancellation commands, the application logs a shutdown message but continues to wait for user input, requiring an additional Enter press to actually exit. This feature ensures immediate and proper signal handling during all CLI operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want SIGINT (Ctrl+C) to immediately exit the application so that I don't need to press Enter after the interrupt signal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user presses Ctrl+C during any CLI operation THEN the application SHALL exit immediately
2. WHEN SIGINT is received during input prompts THEN the application SHALL not require additional user input to exit
3. WHEN the application exits due to SIGINT THEN it SHALL return the standard exit code 130
4. WHEN SIGINT is handled THEN the application SHALL perform graceful cleanup before exiting
5. WHEN multiple SIGINT signals are received THEN the application SHALL handle them appropriately without hanging

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent signal handling across all CLI commands so that interruption behavior is predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SIGINT is received during booking command input THEN the application SHALL exit immediately
2. WHEN SIGINT is received during cancellation command input THEN the application SHALL exit immediately  
3. WHEN SIGINT is received during list command execution THEN the application SHALL exit immediately
4. WHEN SIGINT is received during help display THEN the application SHALL exit immediately
5. WHEN the application is interrupted THEN it SHALL display a consistent cancellation message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the signal handling to be robust and not interfere with normal application flow so that the fix doesn't introduce new issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no signals are received THEN the application SHALL function normally without any changes to user experience
2. WHEN the application completes normally THEN signal handlers SHALL not interfere with normal exit procedures
3. WHEN exceptions occur during signal handling THEN the application SHALL still attempt to exit gracefully
4. WHEN signal handling is implemented THEN it SHALL not affect the application's existing error handling
5. WHEN the fix is applied THEN all existing functionality SHALL continue to work as expected
