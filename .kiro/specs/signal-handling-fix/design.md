# Design Document

## Overview

The Signal Handling Fix addresses the issue where SIGINT signals are not properly handled during interactive CLI operations that use Python's `input()` function. The current implementation sets up signal handlers in `main.py`, but these handlers cannot interrupt blocking `input()` calls, causing the application to wait for user input even after receiving a shutdown signal.

The solution involves implementing a custom input handler that can be interrupted by signals, ensuring immediate application exit when SIGINT is received during any CLI operation.

## Architecture

The fix follows a minimal intervention approach, modifying only the necessary components to ensure signal responsiveness without disrupting the existing architecture:

```

│              Main Entry Point           │

                  │
┌─────────────────▼───────────────────────┐

┌─────────────────▼───────────────────────┐
│      Interruptible Input Utility       │
│  (Custom input with signal handling)    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Enhanced Signal Handler

**Location:** `main.py`

The existing signal handler will be enhanced to force immediate exit:

```python
def signal_handler(signum: int, frame) -> None:
    """Handle shutdown signals with immediate exit."""
    signal_names = {signal.SIGINT: "SIGINT", signal.SIGTERM: "SIGTERM"}
    signal_name = signal_names.get(signum, f"Signal {signum}")
    logger.info(f"Received {signal_name}, initiating graceful shutdown...")
    
    # Attempt graceful shutdown
    runner.shutdown()
    
    # Force exit if graceful shutdown doesn't work
    sys.exit(130 if signum == signal.SIGINT else 1)
```

### 2. Interruptible Input Utility

**Location:** `src/infrastructure/cli/input_handler.py`

A new utility module that provides signal-aware input functionality:

```python
class InterruptibleInput:
    """Provides input functionality that can be interrupted by signals."""
    
    @staticmethod
    def get_input(prompt: str) -> str:
        """Get user input that can be interrupted by signals.
        
        Args:
            prompt: The prompt to display to the user
            
        Returns:
            User input string
            
        Raises:
            KeyboardInterrupt: When SIGINT is received
        """
        
    @staticmethod
    def get_confirmation(prompt: str) -> bool:
        """Get yes/no confirmation that can be interrupted by signals.
        
        Args:
            prompt: The confirmation prompt
            
        Returns:
            True for yes, False for no
            
        Raises:
            KeyboardInterrupt: When SIGINT is received
        """
```

### 3. Updated CLI Commands

**Locations:** 
- `src/infrastructure/cli/commands/booking_command.py`
- `src/infrastructure/cli/commands/cancellation_command.py`

CLI commands will be updated to use the interruptible input utility instead of the built-in `input()` function.

## Data Models

No new data models are required for this fix. The existing models remain unchanged.

## Error Handling

### Signal Interruption Handling

- **During input operations**: `KeyboardInterrupt` exceptions will be allowed to propagate up to the command level
- **Command level handling**: Commands will catch `KeyboardInterrupt` and display appropriate cancellation messages
- **Application level handling**: The main application will catch `KeyboardInterrupt` and exit with code 130

### Graceful Degradation

- **Signal handler failures**: If the signal handler encounters errors, the application will still attempt to exit
- **Input handler failures**: If the custom input handler fails, it will fall back to standard input with a warning
- **Cleanup failures**: Cleanup errors will be logged but won't prevent application exit

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

**Input Handler Tests:**
- Test normal input functionality
- Test signal interruption during input
- Test fallback behavior when signal handling fails
- Test confirmation input with various responses

**Signal Handler Tests:**
- Test SIGINT handling with immediate exit
- Test SIGTERM handling
- Test multiple signal scenarios
- Test cleanup during signal handling

### Integration Tests

**CLI Command Tests:**
- Test booking command interruption at various input stages
- Test cancellation command interruption at various input stages
- Test that normal command flow is unaffected
- Test that error handling remains intact

**End-to-End Tests:**
- Test full application startup and signal handling
- Test signal handling during different command executions
- Test exit codes are correct for different scenarios

### Manual Testing

**Interactive Testing:**
- Verify Ctrl+C immediately exits during booking prompts
- Verify Ctrl+C immediately exits during cancellation prompts
- Verify normal application flow is unchanged
- Verify error messages are appropriate

## Implementation Notes

### Signal Handling Approach

The fix uses a two-pronged approach:
1. **Enhanced signal handler**: Ensures the main process exits immediately when signals are received
2. **Interruptible input**: Replaces blocking `input()` calls with signal-aware alternatives

### Compatibility Considerations

- **Python version**: The solution works with Python 3.11+ as required by the project
- **Platform compatibility**: Signal handling works on both Unix-like systems and Windows
- **Existing functionality**: All existing CLI functionality remains unchanged

### Performance Impact

- **Minimal overhead**: The custom input handler adds negligible performance overhead
- **Memory usage**: No significant increase in memory usage
- **Startup time**: No impact on application startup time

### Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Threading approach**: Using separate threads for input and signal handling
   - **Rejected**: Adds complexity and potential race conditions
   
2. **Async/await approach**: Converting CLI to async operations
   - **Rejected**: Major architectural change not justified for this fix
   
3. **Third-party libraries**: Using libraries like `click` with built-in signal handling
   - **Rejected**: Requires significant refactoring of existing CLI code

### Implementation Priority

The fix prioritizes:
1. **Immediate signal response**: Ensuring Ctrl+C works instantly
2. **Minimal code changes**: Avoiding unnecessary refactoring
3. **Backward compatibility**: Maintaining all existing functionality
4. **Robustness**: Handling edge cases and error scenarios
