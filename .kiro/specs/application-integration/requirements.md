# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Application Integration and Main Entry Point feature provides the foundational infrastructure to bootstrap and run the Meeting Room Reservation System. This feature encompasses dependency injection, application configuration management, and the main entry point that ties all system components together. It ensures proper service lifecycle management, configuration validation, and graceful application startup/shutdown while adhering to Domain-Driven Design principles.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a dependency injection container so that all services and repositories are properly wired together with appropriate lifetimes and scopes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL create a dependency injection container
2. WHEN services are requested THEN the container SHALL resolve dependencies automatically
3. WHEN the container is configured THEN the system SHALL register all domain services, application services, and infrastructure repositories
4. WHEN different environments are used THEN the container SHALL support environment-specific service configurations
5. WHEN service lifetimes are configured THEN the container SHALL manage singleton, transient, and scoped service instances appropriately
6. WHEN container configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL raise validation errors with clear messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want a main application entry point so that I can run the meeting room reservation system with proper command-line interface and error handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is started THEN the system SHALL parse command-line arguments correctly
2. WHEN the application bootstraps THEN the system SHALL initialize all required services and dependencies
3. WHEN configuration is loaded THEN the system SHALL validate all settings before proceeding
4. WHEN errors occur during startup THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully and provide meaningful error messages
5. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL provide proper logging throughout the execution
6. WHEN the application shuts down THEN the system SHALL perform cleanup operations gracefully

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want flexible application configuration so that the system can be deployed in different environments with appropriate settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load configuration from multiple sources (files, environment variables)
2. WHEN environment-specific settings are needed THEN the system SHALL support dev, test, and production configurations
3. WHEN configuration is loaded THEN the system SHALL validate all required settings and provide defaults where appropriate
4. WHEN invalid configuration is detected THEN the system SHALL report specific validation errors
5. WHEN logging is configured THEN the system SHALL set up appropriate log levels and outputs for each environment
6. WHEN configuration overrides are provided THEN the system SHALL apply them in the correct precedence order

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application integration to follow Domain-Driven Design principles so that the system maintains clear architectural boundaries and separation of concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dependency container is configured THEN the system SHALL respect domain, application, and infrastructure layer boundaries
2. WHEN services are wired THEN the system SHALL ensure domain services don't depend on infrastructure implementations directly
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize components in the correct order respecting dependency directions
4. WHEN repositories are configured THEN the system SHALL use abstractions defined in the domain layer
5. WHEN application services are registered THEN the system SHALL maintain separation between business logic and infrastructure concerns
