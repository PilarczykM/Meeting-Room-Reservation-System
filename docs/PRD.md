# Meeting Room Reservation System - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Overview
The **Meeting Room Reservation System** is a simple application designed to manage bookings for a single conference room. It allows users to reserve the room for specific time slots, cancel existing bookings, and view all reservations. The system ensures that bookings do not overlap and enforces constraints on the number of attendees, ensuring efficient and conflict-free room scheduling.

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the Meeting Room Reservation System, detailing the features, business rules, and user interactions needed to deliver a robust and user-friendly solution.

### 1.2 Scope
The system focuses on managing reservations for one conference room with the following capabilities:
- Booking a room for a specified time slot with a defined number of attendees.
- Canceling an existing booking using a unique identifier.
- Viewing a list of all current bookings.
- Enforcing rules to prevent overlapping bookings and ensure attendee constraints (minimum 4, maximum 20).

Future enhancements (out of scope for this version) may include user authentication, integration with external calendars, or management of additional resources like projectors.

## 2. Stakeholders
- **End Users**: Employees or team members who need to reserve the conference room.
- **Administrators**: (Optional for future versions) Individuals managing room settings or resolving conflicts.
- **Development Team**: Responsible for building and maintaining the system.

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Inputs**: None.
- **Outputs**: A list of all bookings, including start time, end time, booker details, and number of attendees.

### 3.2 User Stories
- **As a user**, I want to book the conference room for a specific time slot so that I can schedule a meeting for my team.
- **As a user**, I want to cancel a booking I no longer need so that the room is available for others.
- **As a user**, I want to view all current bookings so that I can plan my meeting around available time slots.
- **As a user**, I want the system to prevent me from booking the room for a time slot that is already taken to avoid conflicts.
- **As a user**, I want to be notified if my booking request is invalid (e.g., too few or too many attendees) so that I can correct my input.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Usability**: The system should have an intuitive interface, with clear prompts and error messages.
- **Reliability**: The system must ensure data consistency, preventing overlapping bookings or invalid attendee counts.
- **Scalability**: The system should be designed to handle one room initially but allow future expansion to multiple rooms.
- **Maintainability**: The codebase should be modular and well-documented to facilitate future enhancements.
- **Development Principles**:
  - **Clean Code**: The codebase must adhere to Clean Code principles, including:
    - Writing clear, readable, and self-explanatory code with meaningful variable and function names.
    - Keeping functions small, focused, and doing one thing well.
    - Including comprehensive comments and documentation for clarity.
    - Avoiding code smells such as duplication, excessive complexity, or long methods.
  - **SOLID Principles**:
    - **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class or module should have one reason to change, ensuring focused responsibilities (e.g., separating booking validation from storage logic).
    - **Open/Closed Principle**: The system should be open for extension (e.g., adding new features) but closed for modification of existing code.
    - **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the system's behavior.
    - **Interface Segregation Principle**: Classes should not be forced to implement interfaces they do not use, keeping interfaces specific and minimal.
    - **Dependency Inversion Principle**: High-level modules should depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations, to facilitate testing and flexibility.
  - **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: The system design and implementation should be as simple as possible, avoiding unnecessary complexity while meeting all requirements.
  - **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Development must follow TDD practices, including:
    - Writing unit tests before implementing features.
    - Ensuring all code is covered by tests to validate functionality and business rules (e.g., no overlapping bookings, attendee constraints).
    - Using tests to drive design decisions and ensure maintainability.
    - Running tests continuously to catch regressions early.
  - **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: The system must align with DDD principles to model the domain effectively, including:
    - Structuring the codebase around the business domain (e.g., Meeting Room, Booking, Time Slot).
    - Using a ubiquitous language to ensure consistency between requirements and code (e.g., terms like "Booking" and "Time Slot" are used consistently).
    - Encapsulating business rules within the appropriate domain objects (e.g., attendee constraints and overlap checks in the Meeting Room logic).
    - Defining clear boundaries for the reservation context to ensure modularity and scalability.

## 5. Business Rules
- **No Overlapping Bookings**: The system must prevent reserving the conference room for time slots that conflict with existing bookings.
- **Attendee Constraints**: Each booking must have between 4 and 20 attendees (inclusive), reflecting the room's capacity and minimum meeting size requirements.
- **Booking Integrity**: All operations (booking, cancellation) must be processed through the conference room's management logic to ensure consistency.
- **Unique Identifiers**: Each booking must have a unique identifier for tracking and cancellation.

## 6. Domain Model
The system is built around a simple domain model:
- **Meeting Room**:
  - Represents the conference room, with a maximum capacity of 20 people.
  - Manages all bookings and enforces business rules (no overlaps, attendee constraints).
  - Operations:
    - Book: Creates a new reservation if valid.
    - Cancel: Removes a specific booking.
    - List Bookings: Returns all current bookings.
- **Booking**:
  - Represents a single reservation.
  - Attributes:
    - Unique booking ID.
    - Time slot (start time and end time).
    - Booker details (e.g., name or ID).
    - Number of attendees (4-20).
- **Time Slot**:
  - Represents the time period of a booking.
  - Attributes:
    - Start time (date and time).
    - End time (date and time).

## 7. Assumptions
- The system manages a single conference room.
- All times are in a consistent timezone (to be specified during implementation).
- Users provide valid input formats for dates, times, and attendee counts.
- No user authentication is required for this version.

## 8. Constraints
- The system must enforce a maximum of 20 attendees and a minimum of 4 attendees per booking.
- The system must prevent overlapping bookings based on start and end times.
- All operations must be processed through the conference room's management logic to ensure data consistency.

## 9. Acceptance Criteria
- **Booking a Room**:
  - Users can successfully book a room when the time slot is free and the attendee count is 4-20.
  - Users receive an error for overlapping time slots or invalid attendee counts.
- **Canceling a Booking**:
  - Users can cancel a booking with a valid booking ID and receive confirmation.
  - Users receive an error for invalid booking IDs.
- **Viewing Reservations**:
  - Users can retrieve a complete list of bookings with all details (start time, end time, booker, attendees).
- **System Integrity**:
  - No overlapping bookings are allowed.
  - All bookings adhere to the attendee constraints.
- **Development Standards**:
  - The codebase must adhere to Clean Code, SOLID, KISS, TDD, and DDD principles, as outlined in Section 4.
  - All functionality must be covered by unit tests to ensure reliability and maintainability.

## 10. Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Users may attempt to book invalid time slots (e.g., in the past or overlapping).
  - **Mitigation**: Implement robust validation for time slots and provide clear error messages.
- **Risk**: Incorrect attendee counts could disrupt meeting planning.
  - **Mitigation**: Enforce attendee constraints (4-20) during booking and display clear validation errors.
- **Risk**: System performance may degrade with a large number of bookings.
  - **Mitigation**: Optimize data storage and retrieval; consider indexing for booking queries.
- **Risk**: Non-compliance with development principles could lead to unmaintainable code.
  - **Mitigation**: Enforce Clean Code, SOLID, KISS, TDD, and DDD through code reviews, automated tests, and developer training.
