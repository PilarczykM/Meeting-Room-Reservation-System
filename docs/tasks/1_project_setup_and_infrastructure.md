## 1. Project Setup and Infrastructure

### 1.1 Initial Project Setup
**Branch**: `feature/project-setup`
**Reference**: `{ROOT}/docs/PRD.md Section 4`

- [x] Initialize Python project with proper folder structure following DDD architecture
- [x] Create pyproject.toml with dependencies: rich, pytest, ruff, pydantic
- [x] Set up virtual environment and dependency management
- [x] Create .gitignore file with Python-specific ignores
- [x] Initialize Git repository with initial commit
- [ ] Create folder structure: src/, tests/, docs/
- [ ] Set up DDD folder structure: domain/, application/, infrastructure/
- [ ] **Tests**: Create test for project structure validation
- [ ] **Acceptance Criteria**: Project initializes without errors, all dependencies install correctly
- [ ] **Commit**

### 1.2 Development Environment Configuration
**Branch**: `feature/dev-environment`
**Reference**: `{ROOT}/docs/PRD.md Section 4`

- [ ] Configure ruff for code formatting and linting
- [ ] Set up pre-commit hooks for code quality
- [ ] Configure ruff settings in pyproject.toml
- [ ] Configure pytest settings in pyproject.toml
- [ ] Create Makefile for common development tasks
- [ ] **Tests**: Test linting and formatting rules
- [ ] **Acceptance Criteria**: Code formatting and linting work automatically
- [ ] **Commit**

### 1.3 GitHub CI/CD Pipeline
**Branch**: `feature/github-workflow`
**Reference**: `{ROOT}/docs/PRD.md Section 4`

- [ ] Create .github/workflows/ci.yml
- [ ] Configure Python version matrix (3.11+)
- [ ] Set up automated testing on push/PR
- [ ] Add code formatting check with ruff
- [ ] Add linting check with ruff
- [ ] Configure test coverage reporting
- [ ] Set up automated dependency security scanning
- [ ] **Tests**: Test workflow configuration locally
- [ ] **Acceptance Criteria**: CI pipeline runs successfully on GitHub
- [ ] **Commit**

## Git Workflow Guidelines

### Branch Management
- Start from latest main: `git checkout main && git pull origin main`
- Create feature branches: `git checkout -b feature/task-name`
- Use descriptive branch names with kebab-case (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`, `fix/login-validation`)
- Make frequent commits with clear messages

### Commit Message Format
- feat: new feature implementation
- fix: bug fixes
- test: adding or modifying tests
- docs: documentation changes
- refactor: code refactoring
- style: formatting changes

### Quality Gates
- All tests must pass before push
- Code coverage must be maintained above 90%
- Linting and formatting checks must pass

### Testing Strategy
- Write tests before implementing features (TDD)
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage
- Include unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- Test all error scenarios and edge cases
- Use property-based testing where applicable
