- [x] Configure Python version matrix (3.11+)
- [x] Set up automated testing on push/PR
- [x] Add code formatting check with ruff
- [x] Add linting check with ruff
- [x] Configure test coverage reporting

- [x] **Acceptance Criteria**: CI pipeline runs successfully on GitHub
- [x] **Commit**

## Git Workflow Guidelines

### Branch Management
- Start from latest main: `git checkout main && git pull origin main`
- Create feature branches: `git checkout -b feature/task-name`
- Use descriptive branch names with kebab-case (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`, `fix/login-validation`)
- Make frequent commits with clear messages

### Commit Message Format
- feat: new feature implementation
- fix: bug fixes
- test: adding or modifying tests
- docs: documentation changes
- refactor: code refactoring
- style: formatting changes

### Quality Gates
- All tests must pass before push
- Code coverage must be maintained above 90%
- Linting and formatting checks must pass

### Testing Strategy
- Write tests before implementing features (TDD)
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage
- Include unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- Test all error scenarios and edge cases
- Use property-based testing where applicable
